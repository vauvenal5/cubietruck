I will try to put together a few scripts and a little bit of documentation for anybody who needs it.

But first things first!
Thanks to http://sigpipe.me/?p=10 and http://www.cubieforums.com/index.php/topic,1134.0.html
These guys did a really great job and made my life a whole lot easier.

Getting started!
----------------

First of all I wanted a stable version on the NAND so I can set up from there my SD Cards and also fall back when I brick them. Also the fact that a NAND will start to fail after some time of use I decided to work on a SD Card as primary.

So simplest solution to this: I just flashed the Lubuntu Desktop Image from the Cubietruck website with the PhoenixSuite or LiveSuite or whatever you call it.
For further instruction on this one: http://docs.cubieboard.org/tutorials/ct1/installation/cb3_lubuntu-12.10-desktop_nand_installation_v1.00

Afterwards I also prepared a bootable SD Card. This will help on this one: http://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_SD_card

Now I simply booted the flash and inserted the SD Card after boot.
Info: The first boot of lubuntu can take a while so don't worry about it.
